section 1: How to run the application? 

1) start server: 
   python mnist_demo.py manager localhost 6666

2) start multiple clients: 
for each client, run below command 
(the port number should be different for each host)  
python mnist_demo.py worker localhost 6667 

3) run the model training and aggregation 
* run via command line 
3.1 start training on each client 
curl  http://127.0.0.1:6666/linear/start_round
3.2 aggregate the model updates 
curl  http://127.0.0.1:6666/linear/get_client_updates

* run via scripts 
see codes in <model_name>_runner.py
